## What are Connections?

Connections act the ingress and egress of Event's powerful data orchestration, monitoring and replay layer. There are two types of Connections within Events:

1. **[Sources](https://docs.event.dev/sdk/sources)**:
Collect real-time events from any cloud app, database, warehouse, internal server, streaming service or file system

2. **[Destinations](https://docs.event.dev/sdk/destinations)**:
Send real-time events to any cloud app, database, warehouse, internal servers, streaming service or file system.

For a full list of Connections, view Event's [Integrations Page](https://docs.event.dev/integrations/all-integrations)

## Contributing to Connections

Event’s core engineering team will be reviewing and merging submissions from customers and the community daily.
