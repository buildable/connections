## What are Connections?

Connections are [Buildable's](https://buildable.dev/) core open-source offering that makes it easy to collect, centralize and action your backend system activity. There are two types of Connections:

**1. Connections that act as a source of events**
These connections have the ability to subscribe to incoming events through webhooks. All received events are securely verified and organized into the [Event Stream](https://docs.buildable.dev/getting-started/core-concepts#stream) in your Buildable account. They work natively to trigger [Buildable Workflows](https://docs.buildable.dev/workflows/building-workflows), which means you can build, test, deploy any logic from incoming Source events. There are three types of source connections: 

1. Cloud apps, such as Stripe, Twilio and SendGrid
2. Databases, such as MongoDB, PostgreSQL and MySQL
3. Servers, such as a web server you run internally

Examples include [Stripe](/catalog/stripe/), [Shopify](/catalog/shopify/), [GitHub](/catalog/github-repos/), etc.

**2. Connections that do not act as a source of events**
These connections provide the ability to be easily referenced within your [Workflows](https://docs.buildable.dev/workflows/building-workflows), leveraging the power of [Environment Variables](https://docs.buildable.dev/getting-started/core-concepts#environment-variables). 

Examples include [Airtable](/catalog/airtable/), [Notion](/catalog/notion/), [Twilio](/catalog/twilio/), etc.

## Contributing to Connections

Buildable’s core engineering team will be reviewing and merging submissions from customers and the community daily. 

If we’re missing an event source your team needs, for example, you can build it using our samples within a few hours or request it our Public Roadmap.
